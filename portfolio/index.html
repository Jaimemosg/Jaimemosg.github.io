        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I hold a degree in Chemical Engineering but have forged a career as a 
            Machine Learning Engineer. My academic journey introduced me to programming 
            languages like Matlab, R and Python, as well as exposure to low-level 
            languages like FORTRAN and C++. These experiences sparked my passion for 
            programming and statistics early in my career.
        </p>
        <p> Early in my career, I developed a strong interest in statistics and machine 
            learning, which led me to pursue a Master's degree in Statistics. I have 
            experience as a university instructor, data analysis and applied research.
        </p>
        <p> I am comfortable working in team environments and have recently directed my 
            efforts toward research projects, particularly in areas such as graph 
            neural networks and recommender systems.
        </p>
        <p>I'm eager to continue learning and growing, connecting with professionals 
            who share a passion for data-driven insights and transformative 
            technologies.
